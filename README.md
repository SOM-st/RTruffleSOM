# RPySOM and RTruffleSOM are reunited as PySOM

This code base is now merged into PySOM, together with what was RPySOM.

Please head over to https://github.com/SOM-st/PySOM for the latest code.

RTruffleSOM - The Simple Object Machine Smalltalk combining Self-Optimizing Interpreters with Meta-Tracing
===================================================================

Introduction
------------

SOM is a minimal Smalltalk dialect used to teach VM construction at the [Hasso
Plattner Institute][SOM]. It was originally built at the University of Ã…rhus
(Denmark) where it was used for teaching and as the foundation for [Resilient
Smalltalk][RS].

In addition to RTruffleSOM, other implementations exist for Java (SOM, TruffleSOM),
C (CSOM), C++ (SOM++), Python (PySOM), and Squeak/Pharo Smalltalk (AweSOM).

A simple Hello World looks like:

```Smalltalk
Hello = (
  run = (
    'Hello World!' println.
  )
)
```

This repository contains a RPython-based implementation of SOM, including
SOM's standard library and a number of examples. Please see the [main project
page][SOMst] for links to other VM implementations.

To checkout the code:

    git clone https://github.com/SOM-st/RTruffleSOM.git

RTruffleSOM's tests can be executed with:

    $ ./som.sh -cp Smalltalk TestSuite/TestHarness.som
   
A simple Hello World program is executed with:

    $ ./som.sh -cp Smalltalk Examples/Hello/Hello.som

To compile RTruffleSOM, a recent PyPy is recommended and the RPython source
code is required. The source distribution of PyPy 5.1 can be used like this:

    wget https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/downloads/pypy-5.1.1-src.tar.bz2
    tar xvf pypy-5.1.1-src.tar.bz2
    export PYPY_DIR=`pwd`/pypy-5.1.1-src/
